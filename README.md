# Project 5
## Background 
For Project 05, I made a fps shooter where the player wanders through a spectral ward/hospital and purges spirits. I went for a more plastic/lowpoly asset aesthetic. The ghosts are cartoon looking and I used hospital props to develop the atmosphere. Some props appear to have been thrown around to display a derelict look. With the maze being a spectral hospital/ward, I opted to make the light sources hover in the air and remove a roof to show the skybox which was a blue and purple sunset. The game aims to have the player gain as much score as possible and then end the game as fast as possible. There are two types of spirits: blue and red. Hitting blue spirits will end the game immediately while red ones grant score. Additionally, there are two beds on each side of the map to give the player options to end the game when able to.

## Implementation / Features added
- First-person controlled character
- Beds can be interacted with to end game
- Used floating hospital lights and added light sources to the models.
  - When exposed to the lighting, the ghosts can change color. this was added as an obstacle to the player to encourage speed through different targets
- Main menu and end-game screen
- One level with a focus on debris placement
  - Assets and materials were imported
- Features a new skybox to build on atmosphere
  - the skybox is a blue and purple sunset which bleed just over the edges of the walls to add additional lighting(or the illusion of it)
- Imported a ghost model, and applyied materials that make the ghosts glow and even change color depending on lighting
- Death/point sound affects for ghosts
- Music plays during maze
- Two different enemies
  - Red ghosts: give 100 points on death, main target
  - Blue ghosts: Faster/fluid movement and end game if hit. this acts as both an obstacle that can end runs, but also provide the player a chance to end the game when score is satisfactory.
- Provided options in each section of the map to end the game. This includes the special patient beds and the blue ghosts
